        <h2>On government incentives</h2>
        <i>posted on 14 Feb 2021</i>
        <p>What incentives might help reduce government corruption?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Whistleblowers are an essential part of a well-functioning democracy. The public relies on people in high positions of power, who choose to jeopardize their job security in order to bring to light information of interest to society at large.</p>

<p>The incentives to become a whistleblower are few and rapidly diminishing as years go by. They often pay a heavy price for leaking confidential information. At best, they remain anonymous - at worst, they become fugitives, hunted by intelligence agencies for the rest of their lives.
The life of a whistleblower is probably most difficult in tightly controlled industries, such as those over which the government holds a monopoly. In these cases, the worker knows they’d be virtually unemployable, should they be fired. Certain occupations are so niche that one’s career would be over if they lost their current job; there’s simply no one else hiring in that field.</p>

<p>This is more obvious in some countries than others. For instance, it might be difficult for a doctor to change employers in a country with nationalized healthcare. This creates disincentives for employees that might otherwise want to blow the whistle on practices which ought to cause public alarm. Similarly, an employee at a nationalized retirement fund might be reluctant to speak out against unsustainable changes, brought about by politicians seeking to purchase the votes of retirees.</p>

<p>Competition has so far proven itself to be the organic way of counteracting this effect. Workers in the IT industry can more easily speak out against their employer, knowing they will be able to switch jobs relatively easily. The most competitive fields sometimes also tend to be the ones with the highest degrees of transparency.</p>

<p>Another possible solution would be that of institutional guarantees. This approach has been largely ineffective in providing cover for whistleblowers, due to the ease with which institutional protections can be unwound. A government may, in case of force majeure, bend its own rules in order to silence a whistleblower, either by convicting them of a crime or retaliating in some other fashion. On the other hand, a company cannot easily prevent its competitors from hiring a whistleblower.</p>

<p>Assuming transparency is beneficial to society, it would seem to follow that most public services should rely on the private sector as much as possible. It would be a straightforward way of addressing systemic corruption, which often thrives in an environment lacking whistleblowers. In societies with corrupt governments, bad actors frequently exploit the inaction of their peers in order to reap massive profits - which they then leverage to amass even more power. This creates a toxic cycle of corruption that is difficult to interrupt once triggered.</p>

<p>Checks and balances are necessary for any system to efficiently perform its functions. So far, many “big governments” have repeatedly proven their inability to police themselves. The solution probably is to avoid placing any trust in an organization’s capacity to self-regulate.</p>
