Hi! My name is Alex and I graduated from [Drexel](https://drexel.edu/) with a degree in Computer Science.

I work at Google on Android NFC for Japan. Opinions on this website are mine and not of any employer, past or present.

I love traveling, photography and taking walks through the city. Also, hockey!
