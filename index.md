Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a [Drexel](https://drexel.edu/) graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science. For my graduate study, I'm doing more CS at [Columbia](https://www.columbia.edu).

I'm a senior engineer at Google working on [Wallet](https://wallet.google). Opinions on this website are mine and not of any employer, past or present.

I love hockey, the outdoors, traveling and photography.

These days, you can find me in NYC. I'm originally from Bucharest, Romania - _salut!_

If you'd like to chat, drop me a line in English, Spanish or Romanian at:
