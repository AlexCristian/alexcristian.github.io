Whistleblowers are an essential part of a well-functioning democracy. The public relies on people in high positions of power, who choose to jeopardize their job security, in order to bring to light information of interest to society at large.

The incentives to become a whistleblower are few and rapidly diminishing as the years go by. They often pay a heavy price for leaking confidential information. At best, they remain anonymous - at worst, they become fugitives, hunted by intelligence agencies for the rest of their lives.
We see the least number of whistleblowers in tightly controlled industries, such as those over which the government holds a monopoly. In these cases, the worker knows that, should they be fired, they'd be virtually unemployable. Certain occupations are so niche that one's career would be over if they lost their current job; there's simply no one else hiring in that field.

This is more obvious in some countries than others. For instance, it would be difficult for a doctor to change employers in a country with nationalized healthcare. This creates disincentives for employees that might otherwise want to speak out against practices which ought to cause public alarm. Similarly, an employee at a nationalized retirement fund might be reluctant to speak out against unsustainable changes brought about by a politician seeking to purchase the votes of seniors.

Competition has so far proven itself to be the organic way of counteracting this effect. Workers in the IT industry can more easily speak against their employer, knowing they will be able to find another employer relatively easily. The most competitive fields also tend to be the ones with the highest degrees of public transparency.

Another possible solution would be that of institutional guarantees. This approach has been largely ineffective in providing cover for whistleblowers, due to the ease with which institutional protections can be unwound depending on the case at hand. A government may, in case of force majeure, bend its own rules in order to silence a whistleblower, either by convicting them of a crime or retaliating in some other fashion. On the other hand, a company cannot easily prevent its competitors from hiring a whistleblower.

Assuming transparency is beneficial to society, it would seem to follow that most public services should rely on the private sector as much as possible. It would be a straightforward way of addressing systemic corruption - which, at its root, originates from a lack of whistleblowers. This is then exploited by bad actors, who utilize the inaction of their peers in order to reap massive profits. These are then used to amass even more power, creating a toxic cycle of corruption that is difficult to interrupt once triggered.

Checks and balances are necessary for any system to efficiently perform its functions. So far, big governments have repeatedly proven their inability to police themselves. The solution might be one that assumes no trust in an organization's capacity to self-police.
