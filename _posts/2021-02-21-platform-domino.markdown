On vendor lock-in and its long-term implications.

<!--more-->

Modern platforms heavily rely on vendor lock-in to retain their customers.

What happens if a company's core service gets neglected and abused for so long that it's enough for customers to leave the platform entirely?

Normally this wouldn't be a huge deal, since different services used to be interoperable. A megacorp's revenue sources were siloed, so they could comfortably lose customers in one area, knowing that their other services would keep the company afloat.

This turns into a trap in the modern world of vendor lock-in, or that of "tightly-integrated ecosystems", as Silicon Valley calls it. If your service is bad enough to motivate a customer to leave, they will take all of their business to someone else. You suddenly lose all revenue from that group of people; one flawed service turns into an existential problem for the entire company, no matter how mature the rest of its products are.
What makes matters worse is the difficulty of regaining customers, once something like this has happened. You will have to go against the other company's vendor lock-in system, which almost certainly means you're never getting your customers back (without the rival company messing up in a way similar to what you did).
If this goes on unnoticed for a critical amount of time, one could envision a scenario where a corporation loses almost all revenue because of a few failing products in its portfolio of bundled services. Vendor lock-in is a powerful business strategy, but can turn into an existential crisis very quickly, whereas traditional business models would normally allow more space for failures.

In this way, one product's flaws can reflect poorly on the entire company's offerings. To compensate, investors might want to start treating entire ecosystems as single products. Companies can no longer cushion shortfalls with their success in other areas; their business model has evolved into creating an ecosystem bubble. Could a single failing product could be enough to burst it?
